# ShowBot

## Showbie for Discord

### Why?

Showbot was originally made for my friend who had a very trash PC and couldn't even open Chrome fast enough. Also because Showbie doesn't have basic feaures such as showing all your overdue or pending assignments and stuff like that.

Discord is also better than Showbie.

### What?

ShowBot is a Discord bot which uses the Showbie API to do stuff. It has some features which ShowBie doesn't and can mostly be used for sharing assignments, solving them together, querying assignments and more.

### How?

ShowBot was made using Chrome's network tab, Insomnia, a lot of time and fun suffering.

### Where?

The official ShowBot can be found [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=786131206923223040&permissions=738720832&scope=bot). (The first release is still not out! ShowBot is still in v0, v1 will release soon)
You can run ShowBot yourself by cloning this repository, installing the dependancies, and building with `npx tsc`.

### Safety?

ShowBot is currently relying on a custom json file database. Due to the nature of open source software, you are putting yourself at risk if you use an unofficial copy of ShowBot, as the hoster has access to the database which stores your passwords and IDs.

Encryption is a feature in the roadmap, but its pretty far from where it is right now.

### And?

You can contribute to ShowBot (by making new commands, or adding a better sorting feature or something) after reading [this](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
ShowBot was made not for actual utility but rather as a *'just because I can'*.
