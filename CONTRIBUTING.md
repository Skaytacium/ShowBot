# Contributing

## Contributing is very easy, due to ShowBot's incredibly modular codebase

### How?

First of all, if you want to contribute, thats great. Fork the repo and open a pull request.

### But, how?

ShowBot doesn't have any official documentation or a wiki, but it works on a file based command system. Each file has a default export of the typee `SBCommand` which you can see [here](./src/typings/showbie/custom.ts).

### And?

Make sure to see the other commands to stick with the formatting, or you could just open a pull request and I will merge with some changes, either way.
You can add your own utilities, and the API folder is for things which interact with specifically the API over the network.

This codebase took me 4 days to rewrite from a single file, do something already.
